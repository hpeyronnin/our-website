	<h1> 2014 Foreign Direct Investment</h1>    

	<p> <a href="https://bl.ocks.org/BruceHenry/1f282ffffdbf42d499b3ee034a4c23d1"> This work  </a> -- inspired us to illustrate the energy gap from an investment gap perspective assuming that Foreign Direct Investments drive energy generation, distribution and consumption. This Marron to Pink color scheme shows the gap betwen states with the highest dollar inflow and states with the lowest dollar inflow. States with a black overlay were not considered in this exercise and states with a grey overlay just didn't have data for that period.</p>
